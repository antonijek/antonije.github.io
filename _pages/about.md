I'm currently a senior post-doctoral researcher holding a Lise Meitner fellowship awarded by the Austrian academy of sciences for my project [Quantum Correlations in Causal Inference and Applications](https://pf.fwf.ac.at/en/research-in-practice/project-finder?search%5Bwhat%5D=%22Mirjam+WEILENMANN%22&search%5Bpromotion_category_id%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Bcall%5D=&search%5Bproject_number%5D=&search%5Bdecision_board_ids%5D=&search%5Bproject_title%5D=&search%5Blead_firstname%5D=&search%5Blead_lastname%5D=&search%5Bresearch_place_kind%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Binstitute_name%5D=&search%5Bstart_date%5D=&search%5Bend_date%5D=&search%5Bgrant_years%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Bstatus_id%5D=&search%5Bscience_discipline_id%5D=&search%5Bper_page%5D=10#search-results). I am also a member of the [Navascués group](https://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/research/navascues-group/) at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) Vienna. Previously, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Roger Colbeck](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/roger-colbeck/).

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in problems within *quantum information* and the *foundations of quantum theory*. I am particularly interested in understanding the physical principles that underlie quantum theory as well as in the dectection of quantum resources and communication in quantum networks.
